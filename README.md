# BO_FOR_RE_SIMULATIONS

This repository contains the python files that have been created for exploring Bayesian Optimization and Inference for validation of runaway electron simulations with the simulation code DREAM (https://ft.nephy.chalmers.se/dream/index.html). The algorithms are based on the Engine for Likelihood-Free Inference, ELFI, (https://elfi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), using the method Bayesian Optimization for Likelihood-Free Inference, BOLFI (https://elfi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/BOLFI.html). The probabilistic surrogate modelling used in the Bayesian optimization is conducted with Gaussian Process (GP) Regression and the GPy GP framework is used for that (https://gpy.readthedocs.io/en/deploy/).
